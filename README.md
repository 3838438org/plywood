# Plywood

## Introduction

Plywood is an open-source JavaScript framework for creating powerful database queries that return data optimized for 
creating complex visualizations. Plywood is about creating on-the-fly visualizations out of ad-hoc, real-time query results.

Plywood was built with these goals in mind:

### Higher-level language

A high-level *domain specific language* is employed to describe the Plywood API.
This language is inspired by Hadley Wickham's [split-apply-combine](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper) principle,
and by [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

### Immutable query primitives

A number of core datatypes are provided to make life easy.

### Serializability

Plywood queries can be serialized to and from JSON.

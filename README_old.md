## Mission statement:

To provide an open-source JavaScript framework for creating powerful database queries that return data optimized for
creating complex visualizations.

## What is plywood?

plywood is a foundation for building web-based applications capable of querying multiple types of databases.
Its architecture allows you to plug in various query engines simultaneously, and its design supports an open and
extensible model benefiting a community development effort. Moreover, plywood is about creating on-the-fly
visualizations out of ad-hoc, real-time query results.
